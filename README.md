# The Flash Card App 

This app will help you learn new words in any language. 

I've used arabic language here. For your desired language just add a csv file in data folder and its path.

It will show you a word, and you have some seconds to guess the meaning of that word in english you have to select ✅ or ❌ button.

If you already know the meaning then click on ✅ button, then it will remove the word from the dictionry as you already know the meaning.

If you don't know the meaning then click on ❌ button, then it will show again util you memorize the meaning and click on ✅ button.

This way it will help you to improve vocabulary of that language.
